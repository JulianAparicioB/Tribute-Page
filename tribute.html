            <p id="Early-age-p" class="paragraph">Blas de Lezo was born in 1689 in Pasajes, a coastal town in the Basque Country of Spain. He was the son of a navy captain, and from a young age, he was exposed to life at sea. At the age of 14, he joined the Spanish Navy as a midshipman, and over the next several years, he served on various ships in the Spanish fleet.<br/><br/>

During his early years at sea, de Lezo proved to be a skilled and courageous sailor, earning a reputation for his bravery in battle. He participated in several major naval engagements, including the Battle of Velez-Malaga in 1704 and the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718.<br/><br/>

Despite suffering several serious injuries during his early years at sea, including the loss of an eye and a leg, de Lezo continued to serve in the navy and rose through the ranks to become a captain. He would go on to play a crucial role in several major conflicts, including the War of the Quadruple Alliance and the War of Jenkins' Ear.</p>

<h2 id="battle-cartagena" class="subtitle">THE BATTLE OF CARTAGENA</h2>
  <div class="div-bar"></div>
  <p id="Battle-Cartagena-p" class="paragraph" >The Battle of Cartagena de Indias was a major naval and land battle fought between the British and Spanish empires during the War of Jenkins' Ear in 1741. The battle took place in the port city of Cartagena de Indias, which was then part of the Spanish colony of New Granada (modern-day Colombia).<br/><br/>

The British, led by Admiral Edward Vernon, had assembled a powerful fleet and a force of over 27,000 soldiers with the aim of capturing Cartagena and securing a foothold in South America. However, the Spanish defenders, commanded by the veteran sailor Blas de Lezo, put up a fierce resistance and inflicted heavy losses on the British forces.<br/><br/>

The battle lasted for over two months, with the British struggling to overcome the strong fortifications and the difficult terrain of the city. The Spanish defenders, aided by disease and the tropical climate, were able to hold out and eventually force the British to retreat.<br/><br/>

The Battle of Cartagena de Indias was a significant victory for the Spanish Empire, and it marked a turning point in the War of Jenkins' Ear. It also cemented the reputation of Blas de Lezo as one of the greatest naval commanders of his time.</p>

<h2 id="Death" class="subtitle">DEATH</h2>
  <div class="div-bar"></div>
  <p id="Death-p" class="paragraph" >Blas de Lezo, the Spanish naval commander and hero of several major battles, died on September 7, 1741, shortly after the Battle of Cartagena de Indias. During the battle, de Lezo had been wounded several times, and his already weakened health had deteriorated further due to the tropical climate and unsanitary conditions.<br/><br/>

Despite his poor health, de Lezo continued to lead the defense of Cartagena de Indias, inspiring his troops with his courage and determination. After the battle, he was hailed as a hero by the Spanish people, and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general.<br/><br/>

However, de Lezo's health continued to decline, and he died just a few months later at the age of 52. His death was a great loss for the Spanish Navy, which had relied on his leadership and expertise in many of its most important battles. Today, de Lezo is remembered as one of the greatest naval commanders in Spanish history, and his legacy lives on in the many monuments and memorials that have been erected in his honor.<br/><br/></p>
